#Inkling

An app for creative people to store their ideas, as they arise.

Inkling on the Web -  https://inkling.space

#Synopsis
The flash of inspiration can strike at any time, but when it does, a creative person needs a medium to record the idea. Inkling is that medium.

My responsibilities as part of this Agile Team were the Front End, and Jasmine Testing working with another Junior Dev.

#Technologies used for the Front End Include:

Three.JS/HTML/CSS/Jquery/Two.JS

#Technologies used for the Back End Include:

Node.JS/MongoDB
